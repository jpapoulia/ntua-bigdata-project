# Data Analysis Project using Apache Hadoop & Apache Spark

This team project was developed for the course "Large Scale Data Management Systems" (2024), part of the NTUA MSc program in Data Science & Machine Learning. The goal was to work with large-scale datasets using modern data science tools and distributed computing technologies, specifically Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark.

The core objective was to gain hands-on experience in setting up, managing, and utilizing these distributed systems for large-scale data analysis tasks.

Each team consisted of two members collaborating to apply these technologies in practice.

## Project Objectives

- **Gain hands-on experience** in setting up and managing distributed systems like Apache Hadoop and Apache Spark.
- **Apply Sparkâ€™s APIs** to process and analyze large-scale datasets.
- **Understand the capabilities and limitations** of these tools in the context of system resources and configuration choices.

## Primary Dataset

This dataset contains crime records for Los Angeles from 2010 to the present:

- [Crime Data from 2010 to 2019](https://data.lacity.org/A-Safe-City/Crime-Data-from-2010-to-2019/63jg-8b9z)
- [Crime Data from 2020 to Present](https://data.lacity.org/Public-Safety/Crime-Data-from-2020-to-Present/2nrs-mtv8)

## Secondary Datasets

- **LA Police Stations**  
  Contains the geographical locations of all 21 police stations in Los Angeles.
